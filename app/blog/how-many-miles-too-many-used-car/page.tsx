      <p>
        Here's the dirty little secret about car mileage: I've owned a 180,000-mile Honda Accord that ran better than my neighbor's 40,000-mile BMW. The number on the odometer tells you something, but it doesn't tell you everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        After buying, selling, and fixing cars for over a decade (and making plenty of expensive mistakes along the way), I've learned that the "too many miles" question isn't as simple as picking a magic number. Let me break down what really matters.
      </p>

      <h2>The Quick Answer Nobody Wants to Hear</h2>

      <p>
        If you're looking for a simple cutoff, here's my general rule: <strong>anything over 150,000 miles requires extra homework</strong>. But - and this is a big but - I've bought fantastic cars with 200k+ miles and terrible cars with 50k miles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The real answer depends on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What kind of car it is (brand and model matter massively)</li>
        <li>How those miles were accumulated (highway vs. city)</li>
        <li>Maintenance history (this trumps everything)</li>
        <li>Your mechanical ability and risk tolerance</li>
        <li>How long you plan to keep it</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Mileage Sweet Spots by Price Range</h2>

      <p>
        Through analyzing thousands of used car listings and tracking resale values, here are the sweet spots I've identified:
      </p>

      <h3>Under $5,000 Budget</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Target: 120,000-150,000 miles</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this price point, you're not getting low mileage unless something's seriously wrong. A well-maintained car with 140k miles beats a neglected one with 80k every time. Focus on reliable brands (Toyota, Honda, Mazda) and get a pre-purchase inspection.
      </p>

      <h3>$5,000-$10,000 Budget</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Target: 80,000-120,000 miles</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the value sweet spot. Cars in this mileage range have taken their biggest depreciation hit but still have plenty of life left. You can find 2010-2015 models from reliable brands here.
      </p>

      <h3>$10,000-$20,000 Budget</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Target: 50,000-80,000 miles</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you're in "certified pre-owned" territory. These cars often still have some factory warranty left and represent the best balance of remaining life vs. price.
      </p>

      <h3>$20,000+ Budget</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Target: Under 50,000 miles</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this price, you should be getting relatively low mileage unless you're buying luxury brands (which depreciate faster). Anything over 60k miles should come with a significant discount.
      </p>

      <h2>The Cars That Laugh at High Mileage</h2>

      <p>
        Some cars are just built different. Here are the models I'd confidently buy with 150k+ miles (assuming maintenance records exist):
      </p>

      <h3>The Immortals (200k+ Mile Champions)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Toyota Camry/Corolla:</strong> Boring? Yes. Eternal? Also yes. I've seen these hit 300k+ regularly.</li>
        <li><strong>Honda Accord/Civic:</strong> The 4-cylinder models especially. Just watch for transmission issues on early 2000s V6 models.</li>
        <li><strong>Toyota 4Runner/Tacoma:</strong> These trucks are basically wheeled cockroaches. They'll outlive us all.</li>
        <li><strong>Lexus ES/LS/RX:</strong> It's a fancy Toyota. Same reliability, nicer interior.</li>
        <li><strong>Mazda MX-5 Miata:</strong> Simple engine, manual transmission, enthusiast-owned = forever car.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Real-world example:</strong> My 2007 Camry has 267,000 miles. Original engine, original transmission. Total repairs beyond maintenance in the last 100k miles? A $300 alternator and $150 starter. That's it.
      </p>

      <h3>The Surprisingly Tough (150k+ Mile Capable)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chevrolet/GMC trucks with the 5.3L V8:</strong> These engines are understressed and overbuilt</li>
        <li><strong>Ford F-150 (2011+):</strong> The EcoBoost engines have proven surprisingly durable</li>
        <li><strong>Subaru Outback/Legacy (2010+):</strong> Head gasket issues were fixed by then</li>
        <li><strong>Nissan Frontier:</strong> Old tech, but that means simple and reliable</li>
        <li><strong>Hyundai Elantra/Sonata (2011+):</strong> They really upped their game</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The High-Mileage Red Flags</h2>

      <p>
        Conversely, here are cars I wouldn't touch with high mileage unless you enjoy expensive surprises:
      </p>

      <h3>The Money Pits (Avoid Over 100k Miles)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Any BMW/Mercedes/Audi:</strong> Fantastic cars when new. Wallet-draining nightmares when old.</li>
        <li><strong>Land Rover/Range Rover:</strong> Just... no. Unless you own a repair shop.</li>
        <li><strong>Nissan Altima/Sentra with CVT:</strong> Those transmissions are ticking time bombs.</li>
        <li><strong>Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep minivans:</strong> Transmission failures are when, not if.</li>
        <li><strong>Ford Focus/Fiesta (2011-2016):</strong> PowerShift transmission = expensive paperweight.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Horror story:</strong> Buddy bought a 95k mile BMW X5 for $15k. Within six months: $2,500 for suspension, $1,800 for water pump, $3,200 for transmission service. He sold it at a $8k loss just to stop the bleeding.
      </p>

      <h2>Highway Miles vs. City Miles: The Massive Difference</h2>

      <p>
        Not all miles are created equal. Here's the reality:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Highway miles</strong> are easy miles. Steady speeds, less shifting, engine at optimal temperature, minimal brake wear. A car with 150k highway miles might have less actual wear than one with 75k city miles.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>City miles</strong> are brutal. Stop-and-go traffic, cold starts, constant shifting, brake wear, engine never reaching optimal temperature. That's why taxi companies and delivery vehicles need such frequent maintenance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How to tell the difference:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check brake wear (highway cars need brakes way less often)</li>
        <li>Look at the driver's seat and pedals (less wear = likely highway)</li>
        <li>Ask about commute history (long highway commute = good)</li>
        <li>Check service records (highway cars need less frequent service)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Age vs. Mileage Debate</h2>

      <p>
        Here's a question I get constantly: "Should I buy a 5-year-old car with 100k miles or a 10-year-old car with 50k miles?"
      </p>

      <p>
        My answer: <strong>Usually the newer car with higher miles.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Why? Cars deteriorate from age even when not driven:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rubber seals dry out and crack</li>
        <li>Fluids break down</li>
        <li>Metal parts corrode</li>
        <li>Electronics fail from heat cycling</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A car driven regularly stays lubricated and exercised. That 10-year-old "low mileage" car might have sat for months at a time, developing problems you won't see until later.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The ideal scenario:</strong> 12,000-15,000 miles per year. This indicates regular use without excessive wear.
      </p>

      <h2>Critical Mileage Milestones to Know</h2>

      <p>
        Understanding when major services are due helps you negotiate price and budget for ownership:
      </p>

      <h3>60,000-80,000 Miles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transmission fluid change (critical for longevity)</li>
        <li>Spark plugs on most modern cars</li>
        <li>Brake fluid flush</li>
        <li>First set of tires (if original)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>90,000-110,000 Miles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Timing belt replacement (if equipped - $500-1,200)</li>
        <li>Water pump (often done with timing belt)</li>
        <li>Suspension components start wearing</li>
        <li>A/C service likely needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>120,000-150,000 Miles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Major suspension work (struts, control arms)</li>
        <li>Possible transmission rebuild on problem models</li>
        <li>Exhaust system repairs</li>
        <li>Various sensors and electronics start failing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're looking at a car just before these milestones, factor the cost into your offer. A 95k mile car with original timing belt? That's a $1,000 bill waiting to happen.
      </p>

      <h2>The Pre-Purchase Inspection: Your $150 Insurance Policy</h2>

      <p>
        I don't care if the car has 50k miles or 150k miles - get a pre-purchase inspection. Here's what a good mechanic will check:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Compression test (reveals engine health)</li>
        <li>Scan for hidden error codes</li>
        <li>Check for frame damage or previous accidents</li>
        <li>Evaluate remaining life on wear items</li>
        <li>Look for evidence of neglect or abuse</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I've walked away from "perfect" looking cars after inspections revealed $5,000+ in needed repairs. That $150 inspection saved me from disaster multiple times.
      </p>

      <h2>High Mileage Shopping Checklist</h2>

      <p>
        When shopping for higher mileage vehicles, here's my process:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Verify maintenance history:</strong> No records = no deal, period.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for major services:</strong> Has the timing belt been done? Transmission serviced?</li>
        <li><strong>Look for consistent ownership:</strong> One owner for 150k miles &gt; five owners in 75k miles</li>
        <li><strong>Cold start the engine:</strong> Any knocking, smoking, or rough idle = walk away</li>
        <li><strong>Test drive extensively:</strong> Highway speeds, hard acceleration, emergency braking</li>
        <li><strong>Check all fluids:</strong> Color and level tell you about maintenance habits</li>
        <li><strong>Scan for codes:</strong> Even without a check engine light</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>FAQ: Your Mileage Questions Answered</h2>

      <h3>Is 100k miles bad for a used car?</h3>

      <p>
        Not necessarily. For reliable brands like Toyota and Honda, 100k is just getting broken in. For luxury brands or known problem cars, it's entering expensive territory. The key is maintenance history and model-specific issues.
      </p>

      <h3>What's considered low mileage for a used car?</h3>

      <p>
        Anything under 12,000 miles per year is considered low. So a 5-year-old car with under 60k miles is low mileage. But watch out for cars with extremely low mileage (like 3k miles/year) - they may have sat unused, developing different problems.
      </p>

      <h3>Should I buy a diesel with high mileage?</h3>

      <p>
        Diesels are built for high mileage, and 200k+ is common. But (big but) - modern diesels have expensive emissions equipment that fails. Budget $3,000-5,000 for potential DEF system, DPF, or EGR repairs on any diesel over 120k miles.
      </p>

      <h3>How many miles will a car engine last?</h3>

      <p>
        With proper maintenance:
        - Economy cars (Civic, Corolla): 200,000-300,000 miles
        - Trucks and SUVs: 200,000-300,000 miles  
        - Luxury cars: 150,000-200,000 miles (if you can afford maintenance)
        - Performance cars: 100,000-150,000 miles (driven hard)
      </p>

      <h3>Is it worth buying a car with 200k miles?</h3>

      <p>
        Only if: it's a known reliable model, has complete maintenance records, passes a thorough inspection, and is priced accordingly (usually under $5,000). I've bought several 200k+ mile Toyotas that gave me years of reliable service.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line on Mileage</h2>

      <p>
        After all this, here's my practical advice: <strong>stop fixating on the odometer and start focusing on condition and history</strong>. I'd take a 120,000-mile Toyota with perfect maintenance records over a 60,000-mile BMW with no service history every single time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The magic number isn't about miles - it's about finding a car that's been loved. Look for evidence of care: consistent oil changes, preventive maintenance, single or few owners, garage-kept, adult-driven. These factors matter far more than whether it has 80k or 120k miles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember: every mile driven is a mile proven. That high-mileage car has already shown it can go the distance. With proper care, it likely has plenty more to give.
