      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">How to Negotiate a Used Car Price (Scripts Included)</h1>
      
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-xl mb-6">
          I sold cars for three years before switching careers. I&apos;ve been on both sides of thousands of negotiations. Today, I&apos;m giving you the exact scripts and tactics that work, including the ones that used to frustrate me as a salesperson.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fair warning: This guide is long because it&apos;s comprehensive. But if you use even half these tactics, you&apos;ll save $1,000-$3,000 on your next used car purchase. That&apos;s a pretty good hourly rate for reading an article.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Psychology You Need to Understand First</h2>
        
        <p>
          Before scripts, understand this: Car salespeople aren&apos;t your enemy, but they&apos;re not your friend either. They&apos;re people with bills trying to maximize profit. Your job is to be respectful but firm. The best negotiations feel collaborative even when you&apos;re grinding for every dollar.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Pre-Negotiation Homework (Do This or Lose)</h2>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Know the Real Market Value</h3>
        
        <p>Check these three sources minimum:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>KBB.com (tends to run high)</li>
          <li>Edmunds.com (more realistic)</li>
          <li>Actual listings for identical cars within 200 miles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Screenshot everything. You&apos;ll literally show these during negotiation.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Get Pre-Approved for Financing</h3>
        
        <p>
          Even if you plan to use dealer financing, get pre-approved elsewhere. This is negotiation gold. Credit unions typically offer the best rates.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Research Common Issues</h3>
        
        <p>
          Know what typically breaks on the car you&apos;re buying. <Link href="/used-car-red-flags" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Check our red flags guide</Link> for help. You&apos;ll use these as negotiation points.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Initial Contact Scripts</h2>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Email/Text Script for First Contact</h3>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;Hi [Name],</p>
          <p className="mt-2">I&apos;m interested in the [Year Make Model] stock #[number]. I&apos;m a cash buyer ready to purchase this week if the numbers work.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">What&apos;s your best out-the-door price including all fees and taxes? I&apos;m looking at several similar vehicles, so I appreciate your most competitive pricing upfront.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Thanks,<br/>[Your name]&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Why this works:</strong> You establish yourself as serious, ready, and shopping around. &ldquo;Cash buyer&rdquo; doesn&apos;t mean literal cash - it means you&apos;re not dependent on their financing.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Phone Script for Setting Appointment</h3>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;Hi [Name], I&apos;m calling about the [car]. I&apos;ve done my research and I&apos;m ready to buy this week if we can agree on price. I&apos;d like to schedule a test drive and inspection.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Two quick questions: Is the car still available? And what&apos;s your best price before I drive out there?&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          If they won&apos;t give a price: &ldquo;I understand you want me to come in, but I&apos;m looking at three similar cars. I need to know if your pricing is competitive before I spend time driving there. What&apos;s the ballpark we&apos;re talking about?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">In-Person Negotiation Scripts</h2>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Test Drive Power Move</h3>
        
        <p>
          During the test drive, find something wrong. There&apos;s always something. Then use this:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I like the car, but I noticed [issue - tires, brakes, small dent, whatever]. That&apos;s going to cost me about $[amount] to fix. I&apos;d need that reflected in the price to move forward today.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Opening Offer Script</h3>
        
        <p>
          Never let them control the negotiation flow. After the test drive:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;Okay, I&apos;ve driven the car and looked it over. I&apos;ve done my homework on pricing. Based on [KBB/Edmunds/other listings], and considering [list specific issues], I can do $[offer price] out the door. That&apos;s tax, title, all fees included. Can we make that work?&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Your first offer should be 15-20% below asking price for dealerships, 10-15% for private sellers.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Handling Their Counter-Offer</h3>
        
        <p>
          They&apos;ll counter. Always. Here&apos;s your response:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I appreciate that, but that&apos;s more than I budgeted for this type of vehicle. I&apos;ve got appointments to see two other [similar cars] this afternoon. The most I could possibly do is $[increase your offer by 3-5%]. If that works, I&apos;ll buy it right now. Otherwise, I need to stick with my other appointments.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Advanced Negotiation Scripts</h2>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The &ldquo;I Need to Think About It&rdquo; Script</h3>
        
        <p>
          When they won&apos;t budge enough:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I appreciate your time, but we&apos;re too far apart. Here&apos;s my card with my best offer written on the back. If you change your mind in the next 48 hours, call me. Otherwise, I&apos;ll be buying one of the other cars I&apos;m looking at.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Then actually leave. 70% of the time, they&apos;ll call you back.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Trade-In Trap Avoidance Script</h3>
        
        <p>
          If trading in, negotiate the purchase price first, THEN discuss trade-in:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I might have a trade-in, but let&apos;s get the price of this car figured out first. I want to keep the numbers clean and simple. What&apos;s your best price on just this vehicle?&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Financing Deflection Script</h3>
        
        <p>
          When they push their financing:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I&apos;m pre-approved at [X]% through my credit union. If you can beat that rate with the exact same terms, I&apos;ll consider it. But let&apos;s focus on the vehicle price first.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Private Seller Negotiation Scripts</h2>
        
        <p>
          Private sellers require a different approach. They&apos;re emotionally attached to their cars.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Respectful Lowball Script</h3>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I really like your car, and I can tell you&apos;ve taken great care of it. I&apos;ve been looking at similar [make/model]s, and based on the market and the fact that it needs [list minor issues], I can offer $[price]. I know that might be less than you&apos;re hoping for, but it&apos;s what I can do for a cash sale today.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Mechanic Inspection Leverage Script</h3>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I&apos;d like to move forward, but I always get a pre-purchase inspection. My mechanic found [list issues from inspection]. The repairs will cost about $[amount]. I&apos;m still interested, but I&apos;d need to adjust my offer to $[original offer minus repair costs] to make it work.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Dirty Dealer Tactics and Counter-Scripts</h2>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">When They Say: &ldquo;What payment are you looking for?&rdquo;</h3>
        
        <p>Your response:</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I&apos;m focused on the total price, not the payment. What&apos;s your best out-the-door price?&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">When They Say: &ldquo;I need to talk to my manager&rdquo;</h3>
        
        <p>Your response:</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;That&apos;s fine. While you&apos;re gone, I&apos;m going to call the other dealer I&apos;m working with to see if they&apos;ve reconsidered my offer.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>Then actually make the call. Or pretend to.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">When They Say: &ldquo;That car sold, but I have something better&rdquo;</h3>
        
        <p>Your response:</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I&apos;m specifically interested in the car I inquired about. If it&apos;s sold, I&apos;ll continue my search elsewhere. Thanks for your time.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The End-of-Month Script</h3>
        
        <p>
          Shop on the last 3 days of the month. Use this:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I know you guys have quotas to hit. I&apos;m ready to buy TODAY at $[your price]. I can have the paperwork done in an hour. This is a lay-down deal if the price is right. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Cash Flash (Private Sellers Only)</h3>
        
        <p>
          For private sellers, nothing talks like cash:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I have $[amount] in cash in my pocket right now. We can go to your bank, transfer the title, and you don&apos;t have to deal with any more tire kickers. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Online/Remote Negotiation Scripts</h2>
        
        <p>
          Buying remotely? Here&apos;s how to negotiate without being there:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Remote Buyer Script</h3>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6">
          <p>&ldquo;I&apos;m an out-of-state buyer ready to purchase. I&apos;ll pay for a PPI at a shop of my choosing. If it passes, I can wire funds immediately and arrange transport. However, since I can&apos;t see the car in person, I need your absolute best price to make this work. What&apos;s the lowest you&apos;ll accept?&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Real Examples From My Files</h2>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Example 1:</strong> 2019 Honda CR-V, asking $24,995

          <li>They countered at $24,000</li>
          <li>I walked, they called back</li>
          <li>Settled at $21,750 out the door</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How much can I realistically negotiate off asking price?</h3>
        
        <p>
          Dealerships: 8-15% off asking<br/>
          Private sellers: 5-10% off asking<br/>
          Cars sitting 60+ days: 15-20% off asking
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Should I tell them I&apos;m paying cash?</h3>
        
        <p>
          No! Dealers make money on financing. Say you&apos;re &ldquo;prepared to purchase&rdquo; and handle financing after negotiating price.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What if they won&apos;t negotiate at all?</h3>
        
        <p>
          Walk away. There are always other cars. The only exception: true unicorn vehicles (rare specs, ultra-low miles, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Is it better to negotiate over email?</h3>
        
        <p>
          Email is great for initial contact and getting competing offers. But final negotiation usually happens in person or over phone.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How do I negotiate on a car with &ldquo;no haggle&rdquo; pricing?</h3>
        
        <p>
          Everything&apos;s negotiable. Try: &ldquo;I understand your pricing policy, but I&apos;ve found the same car for $X less elsewhere. Can you match it or should I go with them?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
        
        <p>
          Negotiating isn&apos;t about winning or losing. It&apos;s about getting a fair deal where both parties feel okay. Use these scripts as templates, but adapt them to your style. The key is preparation, patience, and the willingness to walk away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember: The person who needs the deal least has the most power. Act like you don&apos;t need this specific car, because you don&apos;t. There&apos;s always another one.
        </p>
